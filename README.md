_Illustration of the proposed very large-scale multiobjective optimization framework (VMOF). 1. Initialize a set of directions and solutions and randomly partition them into several groups. 2. Sample and recommend a direction for each group. 3. Fine-tune directions for all solutions based on recommended directions. 4. Evolve each solution according to fine-tuned directions._
